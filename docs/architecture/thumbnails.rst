Thumbnails
==========

Remote-works uses `VersatileImageField <https://github.com/respondcreate/django-versatileimagefield>`_ replacement for Django's ImageField.
For performance reasons, in non-debug mode thumbnails are pregenerated by the worker's task, fired after saving the instance.
Accessing missing image will result in 404 error.

In debug mode thumbnails are generated on demand.


Generating Skills Thumbnails Manually
---------------------------------------

Create missing thumbnails for all SkillImage instances.

.. code-block:: console

 $ python manage.py create_thumbnails


Deleting Images
---------------

Image renditions are not deleted automatically with the Image instance, so is the main image.
More on deleting images can be found in `VersatileImageField documentation <https://django-versatileimagefield.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deleting_created_images.html>`_
