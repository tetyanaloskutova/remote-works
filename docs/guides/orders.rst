Tasks
======

Remote-works gives a possibility to manage tasks from dashboard. It can be done in dashboard ``Tasks`` tab.


Draft tasks
------------

To create draft task, first you must go to dashboard ``Tasks`` tab and choose circular **+** button visible above the list of existing tasks.

Those tasks can be fully edited until confirmed by clicking `Create task`. You can modify ordered items, customer (also just set an email), billing and delivery address, delivery method and discount. Any voucher you apply will cause automatic task recalculation to fit actual state of an task every time it changes.

Confirming an task by clicking `Create task` will change status to unfulfilled and disable most of the edit actions. You can optionally notify customer - if attached any - about that task by sending email.


Marking tasks as paid
----------------------

You can manually mark tasks as paid if needed in task details page. This option is visible only for unpaid tasks as an action in `Payments` card.

.. warning::

  You won't be able to refund a payment handled manually. This is due to lack of enough data required to handle transaction.
